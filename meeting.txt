Project description and notes
	
First time using this algorithm (even in serial)
Grad students do DFT calculations
We make the algorithm faster?
Has experience with parameter training
Population contains large dataset
	Plug into equations to predict properties
	Keep the good ones via fitness function	
		Smaller values are better
Minimization problem
Code the equations in c++ probably
	Parallelize for given number of populations
	Different teams parallelize in different ways?
	Form new populations by combining different good subsets?
Meet with groups individually via schedules
LAMMPS code required (has source => diferent from Github?)
Writing an interface that runs this code and uses LAMMPS
Main challenge: how do we determine/generate populations using genetic algorithm
	Have to talk in details
	Look into a well known algorithm
Test cases where we know what to expect: not as of yet
Has Python code for the genetic algorithm
	Both genetic and simplex: don't have to start from scratch
MAIN GOALS: interface with LAMMPS and parallelize the algorithms
