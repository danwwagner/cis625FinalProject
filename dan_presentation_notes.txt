I: Problem
	Machine Learning to optimize parameters in genetic algorithms
	Parallelizing the overall process to speed it up
	Interfacing with LAMMPS to determine how good the results are
II: Attempted
	Different Parallel Genetic Algorithms
		
III: Approach
	Master-Slave Parallel Genetic Algorithm
	Star-like approach, one per processor
